# Miscellaneous
miscellaneous academic projects

This repo is dedicated to smaller sized, self-contained academic projects I encountered along the way.
It encompasses a variety of subjects including c/cpp programming, MIPs, bash script, logisim circuits, concurrent programming as well as numerical computation methods.

For reference, I have also attached pdf describing what they do to each of them. 

The newly added webDev folder includes mainly django projects written with css, html, javascript, and sqlite. Testing is done with selenium and python unit testing. It also includes workflow management such as git action and docker.
