miscellaneous academic projects

This repo is dedicated to smaller sized, self-contained academic projects I encountered along the way.
It encompasses a variety of subjects including c/cpp programming, MIPs, bash script, logisim circuits, concurrent programming as well as numerical computation methods.

For reference, I have also attached pdf describing what they do to each of them.
